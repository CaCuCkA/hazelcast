# Hazelcast Examples
This project is designed to showcase the powerful features of Hazelcast IMDG (In-Memory Data Grid), an open-source distributed in-memory data store and computation platform that provides a wide array of distributed data structures and concurrency primitives.

## Requirements

* Python 3.6+
* Hazelcast IMDG server (for the Hazelcast cluster)
* Hazelcast Python client
* Docker, docker-compose

## Setting Up Hazelcast Cluster
To setup Hazelcast cluster we should run `docker-compose.yml`:
```bash
$ sudo docker-compose up
```
